Create a Responsive Webpage Using HTML & CSS

This HTML and CSS code represents a webpage layout with different sections styled for responsiveness. The HTML includes sections for an introduction, quality designs, a simple paragraph, and a custom-made section. CSS is used to style the layout, including fonts, colors, and responsive design. The design incorporates Google Fonts and follows a mobile-first approach with media queries for larger screens. The container class sets the width and margin of the content, while various sections have specific styling such as background colors and font styles. Media queries adjust the layout for screens with a minimum width of 600px, ensuring proper display on different devices.
